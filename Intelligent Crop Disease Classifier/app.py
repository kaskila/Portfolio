        "Cause": "Water mold infection caused by *Phytophthora infestans*, thrives in cool, wet conditions.",
        "Treatment": "Use resistant varieties, apply systemic fungicides, and remove infected plants."},
    "Leaf Mold": {"Cause": "Fungal infection caused by *Passalora fulva*, thrives in humid environments.",
                  "Treatment": "Increase air circulation, remove infected leaves, and apply fungicides."},

        "Cause": "Fungal infection, caused by *Corynespora cassiicola*, characterized by round lesions with dark centers.",
        "Treatment": "Use recommended fungicides, practice crop rotation, and improve plant spacing."},
    "Tomato Mosaic Virus": {"Cause": "Viral infection spread by aphids, causing yellowing and stunting of plants.",
                            "Treatment": "Remove infected plants, control aphids, and use virus-free seeds for planting."},
